# Car-Brand-Prediction-Deep-Learning-

In this model transfer learning technique of deep learning is used where ResNet50 pretrained model on imagenet dataset is used.
Model is predicting the brand of the car image.
Car Images were downloaded from Google for creating train and test data.
3 brands of car with 40 images each were fed to the model for training.
For creating more training data, used DataAugmentation.
Model achieved 74% accuracy on test data which is quite good for such small training data set.
